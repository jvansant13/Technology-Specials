### Creating Game Node
To create the Game Scene:
- First you'll need to create a new Node2D and name it "Game"
- save the scene or use "CTRL + S" and navigate to the "scenes folder"(if you don't have one, make it) and save it as "game.tscn"
### Player 1.0
- At the top of the view port click new tab "+"

### Create a Charater(Player, NPC, or Enemy)
You can either create a new scene by clicking the new tab button at the top of the view port or add the node to the game.tscn and save it later as a scene
- At the top of the view port click new tab "+"
