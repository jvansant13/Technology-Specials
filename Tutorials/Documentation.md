# Documentation/Tutorials
Documentation is a tool given to us by the creator of a technology that can give us insight into how it works. A lot of beginner friendly software will have tutorials baked into their documentation so you can see how each tool is used. These are tutorials that I have hand picked to be most useful to you starting out in Godot.

## Tutorials
These links will take you to tutorials that are meant to be generic, you may have to modify the actions taken to fit your game or your style of creation.
- [World Map (TileMapLayer)](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/2d/using_tilemaps.html)
- [Sprite Animations(AnimatedSprite2D)](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/2d/2d_sprite_animation.html)
- [2D movement](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/2d/2d_movement.html)
## Documentation
These files will contain more technical references on class and methods. It will seem gibberish when you start but as you grow your programming experience, you'll be able to really understand what the class is trying to do.
